    <TD class=master>Sometimes its hard for us to accept that there are links on 
      the internet without a destination - hypertext links to nothing. Many of 
      us question why this happens? how can it be that there is nothing to link 
      to? who is responsible for this? It saddens us to think that the children 
      of tomorrow will inherit a virtual world of broken links and missing 
      content. I received a phone call from master today and he asked me to 
      share his thoughts on this matter. He was very sad at the start of the 
      phone call - he repeated what he said in his previous message that he 
      wants us to meditate for 2 hours or more so that we can move from darkness 
      to light. He also said that we should initiate more people to this cause 
      and help others to find the links that link together. Finally master said 
      we can do this with or without a meaningful picture - what's important he 
      said is that we find all the missing links together and eradicate the 
      world from the evil terror of the 404 error.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></BODY></HTML>
